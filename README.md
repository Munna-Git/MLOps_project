## Project Overview

This repository implements a full-fledged MLOps workflow for customer churn prediction, going far beyond standard machine learning scripts. Inspired by the [fti-churn-framework](https://github.com/markuskuehnle/fti-churn-framework), this project demonstrates best practices in data engineering, model development, validation, monitoring, and deployment. It is designed to be modular, robust, and easily extensible for real-world production environments.

---

## Key Features

- **Modular Data Pipeline**: Separate components for raw data ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, and train/test splitting.
- **Robust Model Training**: Supports multiple algorithms, hyperparameter optimization, and reproducible experiments.
- **Automated Data Validation**: Integration of Great Expectations for continuous data quality checks.
- **Configurable & Secure**: Uses Pydantic for configuration validation and environment management.
- **Production-Ready APIs**: Flask-based REST API for real-time inference, model explanations, and health checks.
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment**: Automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions.
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for pipeline components and model scoring.
- **Explainability**: SHAP integration for model transparency.
- **Extensive Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model development, and validation.
- **Dockerized**: Container-ready for seamless deployment.

## Why This Project Matters

**For Recruiters & Hiring Managers:**

- **End-to-End Ownership:** Demonstrates that I can build, test, validate, and deploy a real ML system from scratch.
- **Production Focus:** Not just a data science notebook—this repo is ready for deployment, scaling, and maintenance.
- **Best Practices:** Implements modular code, configuration management, automated testing, and CI/CD, which are crucial for real-world ML engineering.
- **Beyond Reference:** While inspired by the fti-churn-framework, this project adds more robust validation, scalable deployment, and additional features (see below).

---

## How It Works

### Data Pipeline

- **Raw Data Ingestion:** Loads customer churn records.
- **Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Drops irrelevant columns, encodes categoricals, renames for consistency.
- **Validation:** Great Expectations checks for nulls, ranges, types to ensure data quality.

### Model Training & Evaluation

- **Flexible Training:** Supports XGBoost, Random Forest, and easy extension to other models.
- **Train-Test Split:** Stratified splitting with reproducibility.
- **Experiment Tracking:** (Optional) Integrate MLflow or Weights & Biases for tracking.
- **Evaluation:** Automated metrics, confusion matrix, and SHAP value explanations.

### Production-Ready Deployment

- **API:** Flask app for real-time scoring (with health checks and explanations).
- **Docker:** Containerized for cloud/on-prem deployment.
- **Monitoring:** Logging at every step for traceability.

### MLOps Integration

- **CI/CD:** Automated testing and deployment via GitHub Actions.
- **Config Management:** .env and Pydantic ensure secure, validated configs.
- **Testing:** Unit tests for data pipeline and prediction endpoints.
