## Feature & Training Pipeline

- **Data Ingestion:** Loads raw datasets from `/data` using modular loader scripts (see `<PATH_TO_DATA_LOADER>`).
- **Feature Engineering:** Applies cleaning, transformation, and feature selection (see `<PATH_TO_FEATURE_PIPELINE>`).
- **Training:** Trains models using scikit-learn or XGBoost, with parameter tuning and cross-validation (see `<PATH_TO_TRAINING_SCRIPT>`).
- **Model Persistence:** Saves trained models to `/models` for deployment and future inference.
- **Testing:** Validates pipeline steps via unit tests in `/tests` and Great Expectations checks.

## How to run (Local Quickstart)

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Training

```bash
python <PATH_TO_TRAINING_SCRIPT>
```

### 3. Start Flask Server

```bash
export FLASK_APP=<PATH_TO_FLASK_APP>
flask run
```

### 4. Run Inference (example)

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"input_data": <SAMPLE_INPUT_JSON>}' \
    http://localhost:5000/<ENDPOINT_URL>
```

## Docker usage

### Build

```bash
docker build -t mlops_project .
```

### Sample .env.docker

```env
DATA_PATH=/app/data
MODEL_PATH=/app/models
```

### Run with Volumes

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 \
  -v /local/path/to/data:/app/data \
  -v /local/path/to/models:/app/models \
  --env-file .env.docker \
  mlops_project
```

*This mounts local data and model directories into the container for persistent access.*

## CI/CD & Testing

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates linting (isort, flake8), unit tests, and deployment flows.
- **Continuous Integration:** Every commit triggers style checks, unit tests, and data validation (Great Expectations).
- **Continuous Deployment:** On merge to main, Docker images are built and published to DockerHub using secrets for secure authentication.
- **Testing:** `/tests` includes unit tests; Great Expectations suite validates data integrity.

---

## Model Explainability & Validation

- **SHAP:** Generates feature importance and impact visualizations after training, supporting business transparency.
- **Great Expectations:** Ensures input data meets expectations before training/inference.
- **Validation:** Automated checks for feature consistency, schema compliance, and output sanity.

## MLOps Project — Challenges & Solutions

**1. Git & Terminal Setup**  
- *Problem:* New to using GitHub via terminal; accidentally pushed the entire venv folder despite .gitignore.  
- *Solution:* Repeated practice led to mastering terminal-based Git operations quickly.

**2. Model Pipeline Development**  
- *Problem:* Transitioning from a simple XGBoost notebook to a modular pipeline (abstract classes, data cleaning, train/test split, etc.) was challenging.  
- *Solution:* Broke the task into smaller components, implemented robust `src` structure, and ensured proper pipeline flow and testing.

**3. Entrypoint Integration**  
- *Problem:* Integrating training and inference logic caused multiple runtime issues.
  - Duplicate CustomerId columns
  - Object-type columns in numeric inputs
  - Feature mismatch between train/inference
  - Missing Flask route for predictions
  - src import errors in GitHub Actions
  - Missing CardType column in test data
- *Solution:* Debugged step-by-step and resolved all data/module-level errors.

**4. Continuous Integration (CI)**  
- *Problem:* Linting and testing failed for minor style issues and feature encoding mismatches.  
- *Solution:* Automated formatting (isort), ignored minor warnings (E203, W503), fixed test data encoding issues, and achieved a passing CI pipeline.

**5. Dockerization**  
- *Problem 1:* .sh entrypoint script failed due to line-ending mismatch (LF vs CRLF).  
  - *Solution:* Fixed with Git config:
    ```bash
    git config core.autocrlf false
    git rm --cached entrypoint-wrapper.sh
    git add entrypoint-wrapper.sh
    git commit -m "Fix LF endings for Docker"
    ```
- *Problem 2:* Missing data/model files inside Docker image.
  - *Solution:* Used `.env.docker` for container paths and Docker volumes:
    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 \
      -v D:/mlops_project/data:/app/data \
      -v D:/mlops_project/models:/app/models \
      mlops_project
    ```
  - *Outcome:* Container built and ran successfully, with deployment to DockerHub.

**6. Continuous Deployment (CD) & GitHub Secrets**  
- *Problem:* Setting up CD for Docker push and managing environment variables.  
- *Solution:* Integrated GitHub Secrets for credentials and automated DockerHub publishing in `cd.yml`.
